**Frida 101 - Testing Mobile Apps**

**Summary:**
Frida is a world-renowned tool for security professionals in numerous fields. This open-source project gives analysts incredible visibility into executables at run time, allowing a security analyst to understand how a mobile app performs secure operations.

With support from the founder and many contributors to Frida, we have developed an introductory course for security professionals of all levels to begin to use this powerful tool. We will start at the beginning with reverse engineering basics, then move into Frida, and finally will provide some hands-on examples. We hope to empower security professionals to be more effective and build an important skill in the mobile appsec world.

**TALK #2:**

**------------**

**High-level tactics for reverse engineering software

**Summary:**
Reverse engineering is difficult. It's easy to get lost in a sea of assembly, not knowing what to review next. This quick talk provides guidance on how you can efficiently review a closed-source binary. The discussion will stick to reverse engineering in general and will not focus on any applied area like reviewing malware, performing exploit development, etc.

**Presenter:**
Adam Greenhill

Adam is a Senior Security Consultant with in-depth knowledge about application security and penetration testing. He has conducted countless network and web/mobile application security assessments. Adam also works regularly on more specialized projects such as testing IoT devices.
