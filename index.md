**Presentation summary:**

**Lift and Adrift: Understanding Threats in an AWS Environment**

The security landscape continues to change as more workloads migrate to cloud services such as AWS. At this point, attacks targeting on-premise environments are generally well understood and mitigated. However, the complexity of cloud services and the ease with which they can be used lead to an array of new attack vectors arising from misconfigured resources.

This talk will provide examples of these new attack vectors in AWS environments, ways to identify these vectors, and finally steps to mitigate them (individually and across an organisation). It is intended to be an introductory talk, and does not require advanced knowledge of AWS services.
