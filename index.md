Upcoming Sessions

**Location**: online on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fnEy1q0TZ0

**TALK #1:**

**------------**

**Designing a Security Champions Program From Scratch**

**Summary:**

Security teams often have to try to foster a security culture in their organization while only representing a minuscule fraction of the entire engineering organization and competing against a number of other priorities. Security champions are seen as a way for security teams to extend their reach and impact. From a thousand foot view this can seem like an obvious solution; it doesn't make plain the friction many security teams will experience trying to implement this themselves.

**Presenter:**

Connor McKinnon is a Security Engineer specializing in Application Security. His background includes extensive experience developing distributed full-stack web applications as well as project management in the roles of project lead, coach, and mentor.
He is passionate about helping people better understand cyber security and inspiring developers and teams to adopt the mindset that security is everyone's responsibility.

**TALK #2:**

**------------**

**Introduction to Threat Modeling**

**Summary:**

This talk will introduce the concept of Threat Modeling, summarize existing Threat Modeling methodologies, and deep-dive into one of these methodologies – Synopsys Threat Modeling Approach. The approach consists of three steps: model the application, threat analysis, and threat prioritization – we will explore each of these steps in details during the presentation.

**Presenter:**
