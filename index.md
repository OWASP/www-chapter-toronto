**Presentation summary:**

**How to Use Access Guardrails to Protect Your Cloud & Empower DevOps**

Managing identities and access inside cloud environments is completely different from the corporate environment. We love Linux because it’s so fast to build and deploy web apps, but the minute you want to put any kind of centralized security or control over that environment, you risk running DevOps into the ground.

The fact is, we need DevOps to run fast and lean, but we also need a centralized way to manage access, secure cloud-based systems, and enforce security policies on cloud hosts, virtualized servers, and containers. In this session, we’ll talk about moving from heavy-handed access control to lightweight, agile access guardrails that are built specifically for DevOps.

Watch this presentation and learn how to implement:

- Real-time user session monitoring for visibility and audit/compliance
- Just-in-time access approvals and pre-execution blocks using 2FA or Slack/Teams
- Threat detection and alerting for Linux based attack vectors
- Identity-based policy for shared accounts and root-access users
