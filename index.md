**Intro to OWASP’s ZED Attack Proxy**

**Summary:**

Called OWASP’s most underappreciated project by some (i.e., me), Zed attack proxy (ZAP) is great for both scanning web applications and manually inspecting them. This presentation will provide an overview of ZAP, tips on how to configure it for a nicer user experience, demos of common manual penetration testing use cases, as well as how to leverage its scanning capabilities. This talk is designed to be approachable, and is aimed at people who are interested in seeing what ZAP has to offer from a penetration testing, and web application scanning point of view.
