**TALK #1**

**-----------**

**Technical Writing 101: A Pentester's Perspective**

**Summary:**

This presentation is derived from my experience as an OffSec SME at KPMG. I’ve lead numerous pentest engagements, and when it comes down to doing QA on reports, I notice that a lot of people who are technically gifted are sometimes not able to communicate their amazing findings through a convincing and easy-to understand report that will be presented to people who are less technically inclined.

The focus of the talk is that, I hope to be able to help inform others on “good” vs “bad” writing language, format, and delivery from the offensive security stand point. Target audience is new grads, students, professionals, and pretty much anyone else including those at the executives level who are interested in creating impactful and easy-to-understand reports, as well as reading them and understanding the process of creating a pentest report.

**Presenter:**

**Ignatius Michael**

I’m security enthusiast, passionate in all things security specifically within offensive security. Currently serving my second year at KPMG as a penetration tester (mobile, web app, and network). Pretty much a glorified script kiddie with OSCP who is currently enrolled in OSEP.


**TALK #2**

**-----------**

**Cybersecurity Through the Eyes of Psychology**

**Summary:**

This presentation takes a look at how social engineering attacks work from a psychology perspective. Many cybersecurity issues are human problems, and human behaviour has been studied for longer than cybersecurity has existed as an industry. By understanding and explaining the drivers behind human behaviour, people and organizations can learn how to better protect themselves from attacks.

**Presenter:**
