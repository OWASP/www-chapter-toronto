Upcoming Sessions
-----------------

**Date/Time**: February 5, 2021, 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM EDT

**Location**: online using WealthSimple's Zoom: https://wealthsimple.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_IgZHxfX7RbO4cfvP9qs3UA

**Unicode vulnerabilities that could byͥte you**

**Summary:**

Millions of threat modelling talks, few talk about:
- Not how to do threat modelling but why we do it
- Not what activities do we do, but what those activities do for us.

Join Opheliar Chan to learn about key terms and concepts of threat modelling and threat assessment with a focus on the why. If you're looking for a How-To, this is not the talk you're looking for. If you're looking to understand how threat modelling fits into the big picture, please join us!

**Presenter:**

**Opheliar Chan**

Opheliar Chan spends most of her time trying to make software security more accessible, pragmatic, and FUD-free, both as Director of Advisory at Security Compass, while moonlighting as co-lead of the OWASP Toronto Chapter, or as a volunteer or advisor for other infosec groups. For over a decade, she has focused on application security, SDLC process consulting and implementations, program building, penetration testing/vulnerability assessments, and related.

You can usually find her in-person at OWASP Toronto Meetups, or at opheliar.chan@owasp.org.

**Unicode vulnerabilities that could byͥte you**

**Summary:**

The number of Unicode code points has never stopped growing just like its integration in modern technologies. Web applications you have developed or used are likely to support input and output formatted in UTF-8 character encoding.

In this talk, you will learn about the security implications of encoding conversion. Normalizing a UTF-8 string to ASCII only character has numerous potential side effects. The latest research affecting Unicode will be summarized including the HostSplit attack. The HostSplit attack abuses minor characters conversion to trigger open redirect or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Aside from normalization, uppercase and lowercase transformations can introduce vulnerabilities. Encoding can be used to circumvent security controls such as Web Application Firewalls. Additionally, punycode is the new representation to support domains with special characters outside of ASCII. This representation can be used to create visual confusion to end users.

While some issues were patched in major software, many risks remain or are likely to resurface. Get ready for a complete summary of everything security professionals should know about Unicode!
